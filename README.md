# Cmb Minigames
*An open source minecraft minigames plugin, including a party system*

## Minigames
Currently, the plugin includes the following minigames:
- Manhunt - A minigame where one player is the runner and the rest are hunters. The runner must beat the game before being killed by the hunters
- Block Shuffle - A minigame where all players get a random block, which they have to stand on before the 5 minute timer runs out

## Upcomming Minigames
There are minigames that aren't yet implemented, but are planned for the future

- Team Tower Spleef - A 2-team game where you need to fill in a layer of snow with your teams color wool, and kill players by using snowballs and diamond shovels to knock them off the playing field. 5 layers, and whichever team claims the most layers, wins.
- Raining Bombs (sounds familliar, iykyk) - A minigame where you have to dodge TNT that fall from the sky. Every once in a while, you'll be given a fireball to shoot at the other players. Last one standing wins.
- Delivery - Get some kind of food item and locate an NPC to give it to. Whoever has the most after 5 minutes wins
